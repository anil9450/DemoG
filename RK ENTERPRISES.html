        Medicine is the art,science,and practice of caring for a patient and managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment
         or palliation of their injury or disease. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore
         ention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics,
          and &nbsp;&emsp;<b><u><i>MEDICAL</i></u></b>.
         ose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as
          psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.
        Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently 
        connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers
        for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries
         since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the 
         of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the 
         cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.
        Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine or folk medicine, which remains commonly used in the absence of 
        scientific medicine, and are thus called alternative medicine. Alternative treatments outside of scientific medicine having safety and 
        efficacy concerns are termed quackery.</font></p>
