    <h1> THIS IS MY FIRST PARAGRAGH </h1>
    <p align=justify>Whether you see them or not, every couple has disagreements. You may think that happily and unhappily married couples argue about different things,<br>but they don’t.
According to a 2019 study, here are the&nbsp;top&nbsp;three&nbsp;conflict triggers that upset, irritate, hurt, or anger partners. They are:
Condescension (i.e., you are treated as stupid or inferior; your &emsp;partner acts like they think they’re better than you).
Possessiveness, jealousy and/or dependency (i.e., your partner &emsp;demands too much attention or time or is overly jealous, possessive, or dependent).
Neglect, rejection and/or unreliability (i.e., your partner&emsp; ignores your feelings, doesn’t call or text, doesn’t say they love you)
Other <pre>high-ranking contenders</pre>were inconsiderate <font color=violet size=5 face="curlzmt">partners, self-absorbed partners and moody partners.</font> 
But what about the topics that we routinely avoid?<I>While we sidestep </I> thorny areas <U>such as past</U> partners<del> and our past </del>  and present sex life, there is one topic we avoid altogether: The relationship itself.
